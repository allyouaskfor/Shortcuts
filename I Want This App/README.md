# I Want This App
This is a Shortcut that allows you to store a collection of apps. On the App Store page of the app you want, click the "..." button, then "Share App", and run this Shortcut. This will save information, links, icon, and current price of the app. It checks to see if the app is already saved in the list before adding it and let's you know worth an alert window. The only interaction with this Shortcut is at the end when you decide if you want to view your list or not.

### TODO
- Add ability to remove apps from list 
- More attractive list preview
